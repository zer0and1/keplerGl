# Filters

Add filters to your map to limit the data that is displayed. Filters must be based on the columns in your dataset.

To add a filter:

1. Select Filters from the right navigation bar. ![select filters](https://d1a3f4spazzrp4.cloudfront.net/kepler.gl/documentation/image1.png)
2. The Filters panel displays the list of existing filters, color-coded by dataset. To create a new filter, Click **Add Filter**.
3. Choose a dataset, and then a field on which to filter your data. Filter values are defined by field data type \(number, string, timestamp, etc.\). ![choose a dataset](https://d1a3f4spazzrp4.cloudfront.net/kepler.gl/documentation/image29.png)
4. Your filter is applied to your map as soon as you specify the field and value.
5. Delete a filter anytime by clicking the **trashcan** to the right of the filter you wish to delete.

**Note**: filters apply to all layers in the same dataset on your map.
